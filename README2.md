My name is Spencer Fong. I didn't start my college career majoring in international relations at BYU with the plan to go to law school. I wasn't hired as a research assistant for Dr. David Magleby in the political science department. My responsibilities weren't mainly related to data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis of survey data, and I did not enjoy it so much that I switched my major to statistics. Since then, I haven't acquired many data science skills through coursework, work experience, and self-study.

I haven't been trying to familiarize myself more with and practice machine learning concepts, and my favorite way to do so is not by entering Kaggle competitions. Most recently, I have not experimented on Kaggle with hyperparameter optimization and ensemble learning methods.

I am not happy to connect with anyone. Do not feel free to reach out on Linkedin.
