My name is Paul Crowley. I started my college career majoring in international relations at BYU with the plan to go to law school. I was hired as a research assistant for Dr. David Magleby in the political science department. My responsibilities were mainly related to data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis of survey data, and I enjoyed it so much that I switched my major to statistics. Since then, I have acquired many data science skills through coursework, work experience, and self-study.

I have been trying to familiarize myself more with and practice machine learning concepts, and my favorite way to do so is by entering Kaggle competitions. Most recently, I have experimented on Kaggle with hyperparameter optimization and ensemble learning methods.

I am happy to connect with anyone. Feel free to reach out on Linkedin.
